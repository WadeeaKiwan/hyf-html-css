			We were obliged to leave <strong>Al Yarmouk Camp</strong> where <strong>CTC</strong> and our houses were in the end of 2012, because of the war which has begun after <em>the revolution in Syria</em> had broken out. We left our lovely and social center, that was full of happiness and colorful life for the family, the friends and the district self.

		<h2 class="heading" id="last-word">Last word</h2>
		<p class="text"><strong>CTC</strong> is still <em>the beautiful dream</em> to assure the determination of life. It will be back some day and will be rebuild not only in the place where it was founded but also overseas.
